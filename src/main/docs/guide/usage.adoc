To get started with this profile, simply run the Grails application using
`grails run-app` or `./gradlew bootRun`. The profile will configure the
https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin[Gradle-node plugin] with `npm` scripts to build
the React application on build time. Grails react-webpack profile configures Webpack to bundle
React components from `src/main/webapp` into `grails-app/assets`. The bundle will be
generated once when the app is started.

In order to take advantage of webpack's "watch" mode to automatically reload changes, you
will need to run webpack along with the Grails application.
Use `npm run webpack` or use the Gradle wrapper: `./gradlew webpack`
