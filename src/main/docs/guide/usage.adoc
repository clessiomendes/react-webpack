Grails react-webpack profiles configures Webpack to bundle React components from `src/main/webapp`
into `grails-app/assets`. The bundle will be generated once when the app is started.

To run webpack in "watch" mode, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew webpack
----

Client-side tests are located in `src/test/webapp`, and can be run via npm, yarn, or Gradle:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew mochTest
----
