instructions: |
    Webpack is configured to bundle React components from src/main/webapp into grails-app/assets. The bundle will be generated once when the app is started. To run webpack in "watch" mode, run the following command:

    gradlew webpack

    Client-side tests are located in src/test/webapp, and can be run via npm, yarn, or Gradle:

    gradlew mochTest
